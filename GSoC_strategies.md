## Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Strategies
A guide on how to increase your chances of getting selected to the internship program!
### 1. Apply early!  
The earlier you start working on your proposal the higher is your chance to get accepted. Apply as soon as the registration opens up!
### 2. Build a strong GitHub profile
Wondering why we wanted you to create a pull request of your names? Well many of the open source projects use Github for version management and as a remote repository for development. Create an account today and get in the habit of forking other projects, improving them, committing your changes and pushing the work back into your Github account. 
Github will quickly build a profile of your commits and this allows mentors to see and understand your interests and your strengths.
### 3. Contribute to GitHub
Often times, we end up picking out source codes from GitHub and hardly contributing. Be a giver! Look around what needs any changes, what might need your insight, and what needs improvement. Contribute contribute contribute to the OpenSource project out there! Your GitHub history comes in very handy.
### 4. Demonstrate your work on GitHub  
Make some small project as that will allow you to communicate to other users on GitHub. You can also place your previous University projects on GitHub.
### 5. Know your strengths  
Know which technology you are most familiar with and what you should imrpove in. Most (but not all) of the GSoC projects are based on C, C++, Java, Python and JavaScript/HTML5. Start practicing. Take courses on Udacity, edX etc.
### 4. Pick out projects that interests you
Get yourself familiar with the organizations [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/). It is usually a good idea to know what is your strength, what is your interest and what you would like to work on. The higher the interest, the higher your motivation.
### 5. Get yourself familar with the organization you want to work with
Again, check out the organization's website. Browse around to see what they work on, what project ideas from the past GSoC they have accepted, and what are they specificially looking for. You can pick out an organization that interests you on the GSoC wesbite, and click on their 'idea list. GSoC--> Organization--> Moreinfo--> Idea List. For example, here is the idea list for [About Code](https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode/wiki/GSOC-2017).
### 6. Participation in Projects
Your participation in the projects well before the project submission counts a lot. It is not only important to get yourself familiar with the project, but also work on it before and during the proposal submission.
### 7. Write an outstanding proposal  
A typical proposal contains the following elements:  
* Template Name
* Description
* Deliverables
* Timelines
* Implementation
Moreover,it is always a good idea to check out previous accepted projects. These are the proposals of a fe projects that have been selected in the past:
* [ScopLib Support for Graphite](http://www.di.ens.fr/~baghdadi/public/papers/gsoc_2010_proposal_scoplib_support_for_GCC_short_version.pdf)- GSoC '10
* [Accepted Proposals GSoC 2016](https://github.com/solettaproject/soletta/wiki/Accepted-proposals-for-Google-Summer-of-Code-2016#sol-lwm2m).

### 6. Google Codelabs  
[Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/) are essentially some practical lessons that you can do yourself. All the code is available on GitHub. To improve your profile, it will be a good idea to do the Codelabs, make enhancements and push back.
