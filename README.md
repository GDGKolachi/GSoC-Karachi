We will be having multiple talks from local industry experts regarding Google cloud and latest Google innovations in Machine Learning like TensorFlow. Including  **Google Summer of Code '17!**

####Now what is Google Summer of Code?

The **Google Summer of Code**, often abbreviated to **GSoC**, is an international internship program, organized by Google where a few accepted students contribute to open source organizations such as Django, Git, Mozilla during the summer, and get awarded a stipend by Google. You can find out more about Google Summer of Code [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
 
Here, we have two aims. We plan to get you familiar with the strategies to be a part of GSoC '17, and we plan to make the process for GSoC as easy and helpful as possible. So you can be the **Next one** from Karachi to be a part of GSoC '17!

If you plan to attend Google Cloud Next '17 at NED, let's get you a bit acquainted with GitHub and in return you get a goodie bag from us! For that we would like you to add your names to a text file in this repository. Simply access _names.txt_ in the  _pull-request_ folder and submit a pull request with your name in the [full-name] [institution] format on a new line. View _names.txt_ for examples. If you find this task difficult to accomplish, you can complete [this](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) short free course at Udacity. 

So do you wanna spend your summer break writing code and learning about open source development while earning a stipend, and moreover, representing Karachi? We hope the answer is **YES!**
